# landing_project

This was my first iteration of a landing page for The Odin Project.
I went in blind, looking only at prior lessons and exercises for reference.
This project was not intended to be finished but to force myself to strengthen knowledge from TOP.
There ended up being a lot of spaghetti code and frustration.

I do feel that doing it this way helped me explore bad habits and reinforce why I shouldn't do those.
I purposely did not input comments into the html and css files. I wanted to force myself to think.
compare it to Landing Project 1 as a reference.


I only used HTML and CSS for this.
